## The Data
The input to the models is 468 facial landmarks extracted from the input image using the Mediapipe library in Python. The models were trained and evaluated on the AFLW2000-3D dataset, which contains 2000 images of human faces with their corresponding 3D head poses and 21 2D facial landmarks for each image.
